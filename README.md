# Manage Website Clone

This website was made to practice my Tailwind and React Skills (Albeit there could be more refactoring and file formatting needed to make stuff cleaner).
Used Next.js because it's just a static website, might learn Astro with Svelte because that technically would be better in this case... 
but that's for another day.

Tailwind is really fun, made making responsive websites as effortless as possible.
